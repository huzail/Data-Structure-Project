## Introduction
Library Sort is a sorting algorithm which is drived from insertion sort the major difference between the Library Sort and the Insertion sort is that it has gaps and the time complexity:
### Time Complexity
                                       Average CaseComplexity    O(n logn)
                                       Worst Case Complexity     O(n^2)
                                       Best Case Complexity      O(n)
